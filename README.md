# Agriculture-Crop-Price-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the prices of agricultural crops based on historical data, market trends, and other influencing factors. The goal of this project is to provide farmers, traders, and policymakers with insights to make informed decisions and improve profitability.

Project Overview
Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, and crop price volatility can significantly impact farmers' incomes. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict future crop prices using historical price data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors. The prediction can assist stakeholders in optimizing their planning, marketing, and storage strategies.
